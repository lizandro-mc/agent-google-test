# KANVAS-AI: Agent Orchestration Platform

KANVAS-AI is a platform designed for the development, deployment, and management of intelligent agents. The system facilitates communication and coordination between multiple agents to solve complex tasks.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to define and develop a layer of intelligent agents on top of the Kanvas Core platform.

The system is built around a central orchestrator agent that manages and coordinates with multiple MCP client agents. Each client agent is tailored for a specific company that uses Kanvas Core as its foundational platform. The ultimate goal of this agent-based architecture is to automate and significantly reduce the repetitive, manual tasks performed by our users, improving efficiency and productivity.

## Project Architecture

The project is organized into several key components. The core logic resides in the `agents` directory, managed by a central `orchestrate` module.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

  * **Python**: Version `X.Y.Z`. *(The exact version should be in the `.python-version` file)*
  * **Docker**
  * **Docker Compose**
  * **`[PENDING]`**: *Any other required tools? (e.g., `gcloud` CLI, `kubectl`, etc.)*

## Local Environment Setup

Follow these steps to configure the project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY-URL]
    cd KANVAS-AI
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The project uses several `.env` files. Create them from their respective `.example` templates and fill in the required values.

    ```bash
    # For the project root
    cp .env.example .env

    # For the orchestrator service
    cp agents/orchestrate/.env.example agents/orchestrate/.env
    ```

    **`[QUESTION]`**: *What are the essential variables that need to be configured in these `.env` files?*

3.  **Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **`[QUESTION]`**: *Should the `requirements.txt` from `agents/orchestrate` also be installed separately? Or does the `docker-compose` setup handle it?*

4.  **Build and Run Containers:**
    The `docker-compose.yml` file will manage all the necessary services.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    **`[QUESTION]`**: *Is this the correct command to start the entire stack locally? Is there a primary service to connect to?*

## Developer Workflow

### Running the Project

Once the setup is complete, the application services should be running.

  * The orchestration server (`a2a_server.py`) will be active. **`[QUESTION]`**: *On which port? How can one verify it's running correctly? (e.g., an health check endpoint)*
  * **`[PENDING]`**: *Is there a main entry point, such as a web UI or API gateway, for interacting with the system?*

### Creating a New Agent

This is the standard process for adding a new agent to the system:

**`[PENDING - VERY IMPORTANT]`**: *This is a key section. Please describe the steps required. Based on the structure, I imagine a workflow like the one below, but please confirm and provide details.*

1.  *Create a new directory under `agents/` (e.g., `agents/new_agent_name`).*
2.  *Create the agent's logic file, possibly by inheriting from the `Agent` class in `agents/orchestrate/agent.py`.*
3.  *How is the new agent registered with the orchestrator (`a2a_server.py`)?*
4.  *Does the new agent need to be added as a new service in the `docker-compose.yml` file?*
5.  *Is there a scaffolding command or script to auto-generate the structure for a new agent?*

## Deployment to Production

**`[PENDING]`**: *This section is critical for the team. Please provide the contents of `deploy/README.md` or describe the deployment process. Key questions:*

  * *Which platform is it deployed to (e.g., Google Cloud Run, GKE, AWS ECS, etc.)?*
  * *What scripts are used for the deployment?*
  * *Is there a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)?*
  * *How are secrets and environment variables managed in production?*

## Environment Variables

This section lists the most important environment variables used across the project.

**`[PENDING]`**: *Please list and describe the variables from the `.env.example` files.*

  * `EXAMPLE_VAR_1`: Description of what this variable does.
  * `EXAMPLE_VAR_2`: Description of what this variable does.

Please provide the missing information, and I will generate the final, clean `README.md` document for your project.
